# TwitterSentimentAnalysisandMapping
This collects twitter data based on geography and keywords, filters out spam accounts, then uses the Indico API for sentiment analysis and maps the results.

#Configurations:
pip install the requirements.txt
the only exception is Shapely, which needs to be downloaded from http://www.lfd.uci.edu/~gohlke/pythonlibs/#shapely
and then you can install the .whl with pip
